            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                How did you approach the subject? What does your site say about future you?
            </p>
            <p>
                I tried to imagine myself in 10 years by taking what I enjoy the most in University now, and since web
                development is something that really interest me, I decided to make my future portfolio around that. I
                wanted to have a simple website with not too many different colours and keep it clean since this is the
                kind of person I want to be represented as.
            </p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Who is your audience?</p>
            <p>My audience is people who would hire me for a future job.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://marinevasbinder.be/">Marines Vasbinder Portfolio</a></li>
                <p>I like the simplicity of the website as well as the timeline and how it was presented vertically and
                    wanted to do something similar for my own resume.
                    I think her website is clear to the point with her resume and a way to contact her. The animations
                    are smooth and the fonts are clear and big which makes it accessible. There is also some of her
                    projects that we can check out.</p>
                <li><a href="https://watracz.com/about">Damian Watracz Portfolio</a></li>
                <p>His portfolio is once again straight to the point, it shows all the projects he has worked on, the
                    brand he has worked with and all the tools he can use while keeping it clear and simple. We can
                    easily contact him which is important on a portfolio.
                    One thing I would to his website would be some colours other than that I think his website is very
                    pleasant to go through even thought the animations are really simple.
                    He also uses a lot of classes and alt tag for his pictures which is great for the accesability.
                    I really enjoyed the "burger menu" he had and wanted to use that as well on my website when seen on
                    smaller resolution screen such as phones and so on instead of usual navigation bar.</p>
                <li><a href="https://twnsnd.co/">Cole Townsend Portfolio</a></li>
                <p>I did not take a lot from this potfolio but it was still going in the direction I was heading too.
                    There was not a lot of animation but I still really liked this website. I do not think you need a
                    hundred of animations and special features to make a nice website. And I thought a portfolio like
                    his was a good goal to go for.
                    I also thought that the little touches of colours made it really nice and that's what I preferred
                    compared to the second portfolio in my list.
                    But his website was a bit less clear than the other ones as for what the purpose of the website was.
                    I think it is a bit lacking in content and it could be a bit clearer as for what the author wants.
                </p>
            </ul>
            <p>Resource on portfolio creation</p>
            <p>I looked at different portfolios as well as websites (such as <a
                    href="https://andrewcouldwell.medium.com/tips-for-creating-a-great-portfolio-website-f07e063e8371">this
                    one</a>) that gave tips on how to a portfolio and so on. I tried to take notes and applied them to
                my own potfolio and make it my own.</p>

            <h2>Planning</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I checked if my website was colourblind safe</li>
                <p>I used a simple colour palette to get inspired with this <a href="https://colorhunt.co/">website</a>.
                    I checked if my palette was coloublind safe through this <a
                        href="https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23F05454-%2330475E-%23222831-%23E8E8E8">
                        website</a> so anyone could easily read it.</p>
                <li>I have impleted a dark mode and made it accessible</li>
                <p>I thought by implementing a dark mode it would be more accessible because some people prefer to have
                    a darker background so it is easier on the eyes. I learned some basic principles of dark made from
                    this <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web">website</a>. I also
                    made sure my website was accessible by using the <a
                        href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=en">Lighthouse</a>
                    functionality on Chrome which allows you
                    to generate a report of your website. Here is the report for my index.html <img
                        src="img/W3C-check/check_accessiblity.png" /> </p>
                <li>I made an easily readable & responsive website</li>
                <p>I used bootstrap-grid to make it responsive and made sure to use good font associations (with this <a
                        href="https://fontpair.co/">website</a>) and checked multiple websites to decide on my font
                    sizes.</p>
            </ul>
            <p>How have you made the site easy to navigate?</p>
            <p>I used a simple navigation bar with IDs and href as well as a burger menu if the screen resolution is
                smaller. I also tried to keep my website simple to the eye and not too busy so the person looking at my
                website would not be confused.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>Learning</p>
            <p>I had to learn how to use advanced CSS in order to create my timeline, I used a website as an example as
                well as <a href="https://codepen.io/NilsWe/pen/FemfK">codepen</a>. I found these resources after
                researching online through different websites that would display all kind of timelines and styles.
                I used that codepen and changed it to
                suit to my website.
                I also learned on skillshare from Aga Naplocha, a creative coder & designer. I followed different
                courses she made which included small exercises on simple CSS.
                I also learned how to use a lot of the functionality that bootstrap-grid proposes.</p>
            <p>Libraries and other resources</p>
            <p>I used bootstrap-grid mostly for my website after learning it and practicing it on small other websites.

            <h2>Evaluation</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>What worked well</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I think my website really represents my personality and what kind of person I am which is
                        something that was crucial to me.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I think my navigation bar that becomes a burger menu was a good idea to make my website more
                        responsive.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I think that my website is clean and accessible with the dark mode as well as the font sizes
                        which are readable. I also tried to use SVG images for logos and labels which I think is better
                        than PNG images.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>What might be improved</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A lot of code that is repeated, like the header and the footer, and could maybe be stored and
                        simply be called by using libraries. My images may also be really heavy and I could probably use
                        smaller resolution images next time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I used CSS to make a dark mode for my website but it is probably better to use JS instead
                        because I ended up having a lot of different variables to create my darkmode and for a bigger
                        website it might get a bit heavy and complicated. I could have tried to keep the dark mode
                        through out the website instead of having to select it on every page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I think I could have introduced a smooth scrolling animation but I struggled to use event
                        listener with JavaScript so next time I would do more research on that.
                    </li>
